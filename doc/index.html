    <p>
      Put your project report in this directory.  Please use HTML (not Word or PDF).  Please make sure that
      <code>index.html</code> is the starting point for your report.  You can use more than one HTML file if you want, but it is
      not required.  You can add images to this directory and use relative hyperlinks to the images.  You can modify the CSS if
      you want.
